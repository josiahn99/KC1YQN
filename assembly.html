  <h3>Antennas</h3>
  <p>I’m more interested in the technical side of the hobby than ragchewing, so most of my time has been spent figuring out what antennas work best with my HT in different locations. I’m keeping everything indoors and portable for now — no outdoor installation.</p>
  
    <strong>Rubber Duck:</strong> Standard HT antenna. Works fine for close-range contacts, roughly 5–10 miles. Sometimes the best antenna is simply the one you’ll actually use, and this is the easiest grab-and-go option.
    <p><strong>Signal Stick:</strong> Easy-ish to carry and noticeably better than the rubber duck. The whip feels fragile, so careful handling is necessary. Receives repeaters 10–15 miles easily, and up to 25–40 miles if the repeater is elevated. TX is limited to about 10 miles, but it’s solid when you don’t want to temporarily hang a bigger antenna.
    <p><strong>Slim Jim:</strong> Significantly outperforms the rubber duck and signal stick. From a second-story window, I can easily Rx/Tx the W1BIM repeater 40 miles away. With a 16-foot feed line, the radio can be moved around without affecting reception, making operation feel more “real.” It requires a bit more planning since it’s hung up and not instantly portable, but the increase in TX reach makes it well worth the effort.
