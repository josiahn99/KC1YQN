    <h1>about</h1>
  </header>

I came to amateur radio in late 2014 at the convergence 
of two interests. One was reading Liu Cixin’s 
<i>
Remembrance of Earth’s Past (Three-Body 
Problem) </i> 
trilogy. The other was listening to the
<i>Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe
</i> 
podcast.
Together, they sparked a renewed 
curiosity — about the universe and the 
electromagnetic field that shapes our
understanding of it. 
<p>
Radio became a hands-on way to 
explore the electromagnetic spectrum. I 
currently operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a 
Technician license, using a 5-watt handheld. 
I’m learning CW and plan to pursue my Extra 
license, with the goal of operating HF and 
working DX.
<p>
I enjoy the steady practice of learning—
both the physics behind radio and the craft 
of communication.
