    <p>I came to amateur radio in late 2024 after reading <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> by Liu Cixin and listening to the podcast <em>Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</em>. Both renewed my curiosity about how the universe works. Amateur radio is a hands-on way to explore that curiosity through the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

    <p>Through elementary, middle, and high school I studied math, eventually taking 2–3 years of calculus and assuming it would continue to come easily. When it got too hard, I burned out and moved on. Now I’m returning to that foundation, reconnecting with what I learned and approaching it more deliberately.</p>

    <p>I operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a Technician license using a 5-watt handheld. I’m working toward my Extra license. Along the way, I’ll be exploring HF operation, FT8, antenna experiments, basic Python, and taking a hands-on approach to learning about radio and the physics behind it.</p>

    <p>This site documents that process.</p>
