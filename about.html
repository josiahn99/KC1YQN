I came to amateur radio in late 2024 through two interests: reading Liu Cixin’s Remembrance of Earth’s Past (Three-Body Problem) trilogy and listening to the podcast <i> Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</i>. Both renewed a childhood curiosity about the universe and the electromagnetic field. Amateur radio became a hands-on way to explore it.

I operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a Technician license, using a 5-watt handheld. I’m learning CW and plan to pursue my Extra license, with the goal of operating HF and working DX.
<p>
I'm in this to learn as much as I can about the physics and art of radio communication.

  This site is primarily meant to help me track my progress and serve as a sandbox, in a way that will hopefully be helpful to other new hams.
