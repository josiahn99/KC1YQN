    <h1>about</h1>
  </header>

I came to amateur radio in late 2024 through two interests: reading Liu Cixin’s Remembrance of Earth’s Past (Three-Body Problem) trilogy and listening to the podcast <i> Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</i>. Both renewed a childhood curiosity about the universe and the electromagnetic field. Amateur radio became a hands-on way to explore it.

I operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a Technician license, using a 5-watt handheld. I’m learning CW and plan to pursue my Extra license, with the goal of operating HF and working DX.
<p>
There’s a lot to learn, and that’s what I enjoy—the physics behind radio and the art of communication.

  This site is primarily meant to help me track my progress and serve as a sandbox. Also will be posting lessons learned that might be helpful to other new hams! <p>
