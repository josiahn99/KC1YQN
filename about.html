<p>
I recently fell into amateur radio. The Remembrance of Earth's Past
 (Three Body Problem) trilogy by Cixin Liu, deeply affected me. I continue
to consider its commentary on the importance of scientific research, the relationship
between humans and the environment, and the potential future of space exploration. 
Without spoilers, the electromagnetic spectrum plays a large part in the book.
