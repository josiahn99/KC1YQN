I recently read the Remembrance of Earth's Past
 (Three Body Problem) trilogy by Cixin Liu. It deeply affected me. 
<p>
Between that and listening to Daniel and Kelly's Extraordinary Universe podcast,
I have found a new passion for exploring the electromagnetic spectrum through amateur radio.

<p>
I am beginning with VHF/UHF and DMR on a 5-watt HT with a Technician license. 
My plan is to go for my Extra license later this year. Also currently learning CW.
<p>
Most importantly, I am enjoying learning more about various aspects of electromagnetism every day.
