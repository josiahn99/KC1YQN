    <h1>about</h1>
  </header>
    <p>I came to amateur radio in late 2024 after reading <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> by Liu Cixin and listening to the podcast <em>Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</em>. Both renewed my curiosity about how the universe works. Amateur radio is a hands-on way to explore that curiosity through the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

    <p>Through elementary, middle, and high school I studied math, eventually taking 2–3 years of calculus and assuming it would continue to come easily. When it got too hard, I burned out and moved on. Now I’m returning to that foundation, reconnecting with what I learned and approaching it more deliberately.</p>

    <p>I operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a Technician license using a 5-watt handheld. I’m working toward my Extra license. Along the way, I’ll be exploring HF operation, FT8, antenna experiments, basic Python, and taking a hands-on approach to learning about radio and the physics behind it.</p>

    <p>This site documents the learning process.</p>

    <h2>short and long term goals</h2>
    <p> This is a hobby with a million rabbit holes and I'm interested in a lot of them. I'd like to be able to track my learning progress. After a few months in the hobby, these my goals for 2026-2027:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make 200-300 QSOs</li>
      <li>Find a weekly net / ham club to participate in</li>
      <li>Build a homemade 2m yagi and use it to work the ISS</li>
      <li>Pass the General and Amateur Extra exams </li>
      <li>Dust off high school calculus and use it to eventually work up to understanding Maxwell's equations</li>
      <li>Read (and thoroughly understand) Ron Bertrand’s <i></i> Radio Theory Handbook</i> and David J. Griffiths' <i> Introduction to Electrodynamics</i></li>
      <li>Continue to develop website and develop Python scripts
      </ul>
