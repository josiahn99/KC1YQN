    <p>
        I came to amateur radio in late 2024 after reading <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> by Liu Cixin and listening to the podcast <em>Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</em>. Both renewed my curiosity about how the universe works. Amateur radio lets me explore that curiosity hands-on through the electromagnetic spectrum.

      <p>
        I studied math from elementary through high school, eventually taking 2–3 years of calculus. When it became challenging, I burned out. Now I’m returning deliberately to reconnect with that foundation and approach learning more deliberately.

      Some of these are more practical than others. The ham shack is certainly the primary goal. Maxwell's equations, I'm a bit nervous I'm biting off way too much. But it's important to me to try.  </p>

      <h2>Short and Long-Term Goals (2026–2027)</h2>
      <p>
        Amateur radio offers countless rabbit holes, and I’m exploring many of them. To stay focused and track my learning, I’ve grouped my goals into categories:
      </p>

      <h3>Operator Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make 200–300 QSOs across various bands and modes</li>
        <li>Find a weekly net or ham club to participate in, volunteering for net control or presentations over time</li>
        <li>Build a homemade 2m Yagi and use it to work the ISS and distant repeaters
          <ul>
            <li>Model the Yagi in software</li>
            <li>Compare predicted vs. real gain</li>
            <li>Measure SWR bandwidth</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set up a full DX-capable ham shack and base station operating on 20m and 40m, building and modeling the antenna</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Theoretical & Technical Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pass the General and Amateur Extra exams</li>
        <li>Work toward understanding Maxwell’s equations through David J. Griffiths’ <em>Introduction to Electrodynamics</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Refresh single-variable calculus</li>
            <li>Complete a multivariable calculus online course</li>
            <li>Complete a vector calculus online course</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Read and thoroughly understand Ron Bertrand’s <em>Radio Theory Handbook</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Projects & Experimentation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue developing this website, Raspberry Pi experimentation, and Python scripting</li>
        <li>Conduct basic experiments in HF and electrical theory to connect theory to practice</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some goals are more challenging than others, but each contributes to deeper understanding and hands-on skill. Tackling Maxwell’s equations is ambitious, but it will strengthen my grasp of radio physics and connect theory to practice.
