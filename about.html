    <h1>about</h1>
  </header>
    <p>I came to amateur radio in late 2024 after reading <em>Remembrance of Earth’s Past</em> by Liu Cixin and listening to the podcast <em>Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe</em>. Both renewed my curiosity about how the universe works. Amateur radio is a hands-on way to explore that curiosity through the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

    <p>Through elementary, middle, and high school I studied math, eventually taking 2–3 years of calculus and assuming it would continue to come easily. When it got too hard, I burned out and moved on. Now I’m returning to that foundation, reconnecting with what I learned and approaching it more deliberately.</p>

    <p>I operate VHF/UHF and DMR with a Technician license using a 5-watt handheld. Taking a hands-on approach, I'm learning the phsyics of radio and documenting the journey on this site.</p>

    <h2>short and long term goals</h2>
    <p> This is a hobby with a million rabbit holes and I'm interested in a lot of them. To stay focused and track my learning, these are my goals for 2026-2027:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make 200-300 QSOs</li>
      <li>Find a weekly net / ham club to participate in</li>
      <li>Build a homemade 2m yagi and use it to work the ISS and distant repeaters</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Model the Yagi in software
          <li>Compare predicted vs real gain
          <li>Measure SWR bandwidth
        </ul>
      <li>Pass the General and Amateur Extra exams </li>
      <li>Work toward's understanding Maxwell's equations in David J. Griffith's <i> Introduction to Electrodynamics</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Dust off single-variable calculus</li>
            <li>Complete multi-variable calc online course</li>
            <li>Complete a vector calc online course</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Read (and thoroughly understand) Ron Bertrand’s <i>Radio Theory Handbook</i></li>
      <li>Continue to develop website, Raspberry Pi experimentation and develop Python scripts
      <li>Conduct basic experiments in HF and electrical theory</li>
      <li>Set up a full Dx ham shack and base station operating on 20m and 40m, building and modeling the antenna </li>
      </ul>
  Some of these are more practical than others. The ham shack is certainly the primary goal. Maxwell's equations, I'm a bit nervous I'm biting off way too much. But it's important to me to try.
