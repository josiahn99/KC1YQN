# Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus

The AT-D878 is a great first radio — it’s feature-rich, so you can explore many different parts of the hobby and figure out what you like.

Here are my thoughts for someone who just got their Tech license and purchased this radio.

---

## Getting Started

You’ll see lots of YouTube videos and BridgeCom University videos about programming, customizing, advanced features, APRS, GPS, DMR, etc. Slow down.

Many people recommend getting a simple analog radio to start, since the learning curve is less steep. That’s actually the best approach with the 878 too. There’s a lot you can do with this radio, but there’s no rush.

### To Get Your Bearings

#### Just Listen

- Make sure the radio is in **analog mode** (it’ll show “ANA”).  
- Turn the squelch down so you can hear very weak signals.  
- Make sure you’re in **VFO mode**. If a frequency is shown, you're in VFO. If not, press the red button and it should appear.  
- Scan around the bands by holding the up or down arrow.

Don’t worry if you hear nothing at first — but you’ll probably hear something. If not, try at night when there are more likely to be nets.

Keep the antenna vertical. Replacing the standard rubber duck with a Signal Stick is a great first upgrade. Try getting to a second floor, near a window, or outside if you can.

Write down what you hear so you remember it next time. You’re learning the lay of the airwaves, and writing things down helps you see that you’re progressing.

Next, go to [repeaterbook.com](https://www.repeaterbook.com) and sign up for a free account to get full access, and search for nearby repeaters. Ones marked “wide area network” are best.

Don’t worry about programming them in yet — just note them.

Sometimes a repeater listing will include a link to a website describing:

- Where it’s located  
- What nets are on it  
- What it’s connected to  

Make note of the ones that seem active and have good coverage.

#### Try a Little Manual Programming

Before hooking the radio up to a computer, try entering a few analog repeaters you found on RepeaterBook directly from the keypad.

It feels a bit like using a phone from 2003, but it helps you understand:

- TX/RX offsets  
- PL tones  
- How repeaters actually work  

These basic steps will let you enjoy a lot of what the radio can do. Explore the bands and repeaters at your own pace.

If you’re feeling ambitious, try transmitting something simple like:

> KC1YQN, monitoring.

Don’t say CQ unless you’re on 146.52 MHz and listening for simplex stations — otherwise you may irritate people.

## Codeplug Tips

Once you’re comfortable scanning and adding repeaters manually, you can start building your codeplug. Think of it as a spreadsheet that stores all the attributes for each frequency.

If you use RepeaterBook, you can export a list of repeaters in a format compatible with the AnyTone software and import it into the CPS software (available on BridgeCom University’s site).

### Zones

Zones are basically folders for your channels. They are extremely useful for keeping systems that work differently from each other organized.

How you organize zones and scan lists makes a huge difference day to day. It determines whether your radio feels intuitive or chaotic.

I suggest using separate zones for:

- FM repeaters  
- DMR repeaters  
- Hotspots  

#### FM Repeater Zones

Use RepeaterBook to find wide-coverage repeaters for a “Tier 1” zone. Then add smaller repeaters within about 20 miles to a “Tier 2” zone.

You’ll probably spend most of your time scanning Tier 1, but it’s useful to see what’s happening on Tier 2 as well.

#### DMR Repeater Zones

Digital repeaters require the correct talkgroups and time slots, so you’ll need a separate channel for each configuration.

Seeing full signal but hearing nothing? It’s probably a talkgroup issue.

Try turning on Digital Monitor.

You can use Digital Monitor to receive everything happening on a repeater, but you still need properly programmed channels to avoid transmitting on the wrong talkgroup.

#### Hotspot Zone

If you build a DMR hotspot, you can connect to the BrandMeister network and make QSOs without relying on nearby repeaters.

Treat the hotspot as its own zone, with a channel for each talkgroup you use.

On a hotspot, you can change talkgroups by quickly pressing the PTT button (“kerchunking”), but this only works when no one else is transmitting.

## Antennas

Most of my operating has been indoors and not near major repeaters. That quickly taught me that setup and antennas are just as important as the radio itself.

Everything below assumes portable, indoor operation — no permanent installs.

| Antenna               | Range (miles) | Notes                                                        |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rubber Duck           | 5–10          | Fine for very local contacts, simple and ready to use       |
| Signal Stick          | 15–25         | Portable; vertical near a window; sufficient for satellite receive |
| Slim Jim (window-mounted) | ~40       | Indoor terrestrial; reliable RX/TX; makes FM operation feel consistent |
