<h1>Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus</h1>

<p>The AT-D878 is a great first radio — it’s feature-rich, so you can explore many different parts of the hobby and figure out what you like.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts for someone who just got their Tech license and purchased this radio.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>You’ll see lots of YouTube videos and BridgeCom University videos about programming, customizing, advanced features, APRS, GPS, DMR, etc. Slow down.</p>

<p>Many people recommend getting a simple analog radio to start, since the learning curve is less steep. That’s actually the best approach with the 878 too. There’s a lot you can do with this radio, but there’s no rush.</p>

<h3>To Get Your Bearings</h3>

<h4>Just Listen</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure the radio is in <strong>analog mode</strong> (it’ll show “ANA”).</li>
    <li>Turn the squelch down so you can hear very weak signals.</li>
    <li>Make sure you’re in <strong>VFO mode</strong>. If a frequency is shown, you're in VFO. If not, press the red button and it should appear.</li>
    <li>Scan around the bands by holding the up or down arrow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if you hear nothing at first — but you’ll probably hear something. If not, try at night when there are more likely to be nets.</p>

<p>Keep the antenna vertical. Replacing the standard rubber duck with a Signal Stick is a great first upgrade. Try getting to a second floor, near a window, or outside if you can.</p>

<p>Write down what you hear so you remember it next time. You’re learning the lay of the airwaves, and writing things down helps you see that you’re progressing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Next, go to <a href="https://www.repeaterbook.com" target="_blank">repeaterbook.com</a>. Sign up for a free account to get full access, and search for nearby repeaters. Ones marked “wide area network” are best.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about programming them in yet — just note them.</p>

<p>Sometimes a repeater listing will include a link to a website describing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Where it’s located</li>
    <li>What nets are on it</li>
    <li>What it’s connected to</li>
</ul>

<p>Make note of the ones that seem active and have good coverage.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Try a Little Manual Programming</h4>

<p>Before hooking the radio up to a computer, try entering a few analog repeaters you found on RepeaterBook directly from the keypad.</p>

<p>It feels a bit like using a phone from 2003, but it helps you understand:</p>

<ul>
    <li>TX/RX offsets</li>
    <li>PL tones</li>
    <li>How repeaters actually work</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic steps will let you enjoy a lot of what the radio can do. Explore the bands and repeaters at your own pace.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling ambitious, try transmitting something simple like:</p>

<blockquote>
    KC1YQN, monitoring.
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t say CQ unless you’re on 146.52 MHz and listening for simplex stations — otherwise you may irritate people.</p>

<h2>Codeplug Tips</h2>

<p>Once you’re comfortable scanning and adding repeaters manually, you can start building your codeplug. Think of it as a spreadsheet that stores all the attributes for each frequency.</p>

<p>If you use RepeaterBook, you can export a list of repeaters in a format compatible with the AnyTone software and import it into the CPS software (available on BridgeCom University’s site).</p>

<h3>Zones</h3>

<p>Zones are basically folders for your channels. They are extremely useful for keeping systems that work differently from each other organized.</p>

<p>How you organize zones and scan lists makes a huge difference day to day. It determines whether your radio feels intuitive or chaotic.</p>

<p>I suggest using separate zones for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>FM repeaters</li>
    <li>DMR repeaters</li>
    <li>Hotspots</li>
</ul>

<h4>FM Repeater Zones</h4>

<p>Use RepeaterBook to find wide-coverage repeaters for a “Tier 1” zone. Then add smaller repeaters within about 20 miles to a “Tier 2” zone.</p>

<p>You’ll probably spend most of your time scanning Tier 1, but it’s useful to see what’s happening on Tier 2 as well.</p>

<h4>DMR Repeater Zones</h4>

<p>Digital repeaters require the correct talkgroups and time slots, so you’ll need a separate channel for each configuration.</p>

<p>Seeing full signal but hearing nothing? It’s probably a talkgroup issue.</p>

<p>Try turning on Digital Monitor.</p>

<p>You can use Digital Monitor to receive everything happening on a repeater, but you still need properly programmed channels to avoid transmitting on the wrong talkgroup.</p>

<h4>Hotspot Zone</h4>

<p>If you build a DMR hotspot, you can connect to the BrandMeister network and make QSOs without relying on nearby repeaters.</p>

<p>Treat the hotspot as its own zone, with a channel for each talkgroup you use.</p>

<p>On a hotspot, you can change talkgroups by quickly pressing the PTT button (“kerchunking”), but this only works when no one else is transmitting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Antennas</h2>

<p>Most of my operating has been indoors and not near major repeaters. That quickly taught me that setup and antennas are just as important as the radio itself.</p>

<p>Everything below assumes portable, indoor operation — no permanent installs.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <th>Antenna</th>
        <th>Range (miles)</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rubber Duck</td>
        <td>5–10</td>
        <td>Fine for very local contacts, simple and ready to use</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Signal Stick</td>
        <td>15–25</td>
        <td>Portable; vertical near a window; sufficient for satellite receive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Slim Jim (window-mounted)</td>
        <td>~40</td>
        <td>Indoor terrestrial; reliable RX/TX; makes FM operation feel consistent</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Satellite work:</strong> The Signal Stick works for receive; eventually try an Arrow antenna for active satellite contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>APRS:</strong> Set up packet transmit and receive to track stations, integrate weather, and experiment with telemetry.</li>
    <li><strong>DMR expansion:</strong> Explore more talkgroups and time slots on BrandMeister and NEDECN.</li>
    <li><strong>Refining codeplug strategy:</strong> Continue organizing zones, talkgroups, and scan lists so scanning becomes predictable and enjoyable.</li>
</ul>
