So far I've been very happy with no regrets. it was the right call for me. 

<p>  For someone considering it as their first radio, a few lessons learned: <p>
<p><b>Lesson 1: Options matter when coverage is limited. Too cheap can be frustrating.</b>
A $25 Baofeng was tempting, but I’m not close to any major repeaters. An analog-only handheld could easily turn into something I rarely used. I wanted to know that, one way or another, I’d be able to make QSOs—even if that meant using digital modes and a hotspot over the internet. I went with a full-featured handheld to give myself more room to experiment without immediately committing to an HF base station. But everyone loves the Yueseng FT-70 as a More price friendly digital option, and I’m sure it’s great.

<b>Lesson 2: You can still get your feet wet with analog before touching DMR. </b>
I feel like analog reporters operate a more more intuitively and fortunately, if you're just starting out, getting up and scanning the bands or listening to local repeaters is fairly quick. Even with analog, though, the menus on the AT-878 aren’t very intuitive. It’s worth watching a couple of Bridgecom Systems videos on programming repeaters—they save a lot of frustration. It’s better to know you’re not being heard because you lack reach than to wonder whether you entered the PL tone or offset incorrectly (5 MHz for 70 cm, 0.6 MHz for 2 m).

<p>
<b>Lesson 3: DMR isn’t hard, but it isn’t obvious. Patience ands a love of spreadsheet will help.
</b><p>
  
  It took a long Q&A session with ChatGPT, but I now feel like I have the basics down—what a codeplug actually is, and how zones, channels, talkgroups, and scan lists fit together. I’d only recommend it if you don’t mind a spreadsheet-style data organization session, but if you do, it’s certainly satisfying.

I’m not in close range of any digital repeaters either, which necessitated that I buy a DMR hotspot. More info can be found here.
