    <h3>Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus</h3>

<p>
So far, I have no regrets—it was the right choice for me.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts for someone buying their first handheld:
<p>
1. Options matter when coverage is limited.
A cheap analog HT was tempting, but I’m far from major repeaters. Digital modes plus a hotspot gave me reliable QSOs and room to experiment. If your budget allows it, get a digital option, to allow yourself to grow in the hobby. The Yaesu FT-70 is a solid, cheaper digital alternative that Reddit loves. 
<p>
2. Start with analog before DMR.
Analog is quicker and more intuitive. The 878 menus aren’t friendly—Bridgecom’s programming videos help. It’s better to confirm range limits than chase programming errors, and there will be fewer chances of those with analog stations.
<p>
3. DMR isn’t hard, just not obvious.
Once codeplugs, zones, channels, and talkgroups click, it’s manageable—especially if you like a good spreadsheet.
<p>
I’m also out of range of digital repeaters, so a DMR hotspot was necessary. More details are linked.
