    <p>Anytone AT-D878UVII Plus
<p>
<p>
So far, I have no regrets—it was the right choice for me.
</p>

<p>
For anyone considering this as a first radio, here are a few lessons learned:
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson 1: Options matter when coverage is limited.</b><br>
A $25 Baofeng was tempting, but I’m not near major repeaters. An analog-only
handheld could have ended up unused. I wanted a reliable path to QSOs, even
if that meant digital modes and a hotspot. A full-featured handheld gave me
room to experiment without immediately committing to an HF base station.
That said, the Yaesu FT-70 is a popular, more affordable digital option.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson 2: Start with analog before touching DMR.</b><br>
Analog operation is more intuitive, and getting on the air—scanning bands or
listening to local repeaters—is quick. The AT-878 menus are not especially
friendly, so Bridgecom Systems programming videos are worth watching. It’s
better to know you lack reach than to wonder if a PL tone or offset was set
wrong (5&nbsp;MHz on 70&nbsp;cm, 0.6&nbsp;MHz on 2&nbsp;m).
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesson 3: DMR isn’t hard, but it isn’t obvious.</b><br>
After some trial and error, I learned how codeplugs, zones, channels,
talkgroups, and scan lists fit together. If you don’t mind spreadsheet-style
organization, it’s manageable—and even satisfying.
</p>

<p>
I’m also out of range of digital repeaters, which made a DMR hotspot
necessary. More details are linked here.
