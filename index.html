  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This site serves to document my progress in learning all things amateur radio, with some Python and Raspberry Pi experimenting on the side.  
  <p>So far I have a DMR hotspot up and running.
  <p>I'm also figuring out where I want to go with this and figuring out my goals and learning plan.
  <p>Also some tips for any new hams using an Anytone-878 as their first radio.
  <p>More to come soon. Thanks for stopping by.
