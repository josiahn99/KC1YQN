      <h2>Broad Direction</h2>

      <p>
        I don’t want this to turn into ten unrelated hobbies hiding under the word “radio.”
        I’m trying to let it grow, but in a way that actually builds on itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m aiming for somewhere between <strong>100–300 QSOs this year</strong>.
        The number itself isn’t the point — it’s about operating consistently instead
        of retreating into theory or projects when I’m tired.
      </p>

      <p>
        I plan to earn my <strong>General and Amateur Extra</strong> this year.
        Not by memorizing the pool and forgetting it, but by actually understanding
        the material behind it.
      </p>

      <p>
        HF is clearly ahead. I’ve been thinking through 40 meters, antenna height
        (around 60 feet if possible), inverted-V options, and what kind of pattern
        I’d want if I’m trying to work Europe. I don’t want random wire in the yard.
        When I put something up, I want to understand what it’s doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the programming side, I want to keep building small systems around the station.
        The Pi-Star logging automation was a good start. I’d like to layer in geographic
        data, maybe propagation visualization, and keep refining the site so it feels
        intentional and clean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath all of this is physics. I want Maxwell’s equations to make sense someday.
        Amateur radio is the practical doorway into that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operate. Study. Build. Keep going.

      <h2>Winter Storm Reception Test</h2>

      <p>
        During a major winter storm that dropped roughly 24 inches of snow,
        I monitored local repeaters throughout the event.
        With everything quiet and snow-covered, signals were noticeably clean.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was able to clearly receive activity from:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Whitman – WA1NPO</li>
        <li>West Bridgewater</li>
        <li>Bridgewater – W1MV</li>
        <li>Walpole – K1HRV</li>
        <li>Cumberland – NB1RI</li>
        <li>Providence – R1MIX</li>
        <li>Whitman</li>
        <li>Portsmouth – W1SYE</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This confirmed solid receive coverage across southeastern Massachusetts
        and into Rhode Island, even under heavy winter conditions.
        The station performed reliably.
