      <h3>November 20–30, 2025 — Radio Purchase</h3>
      <p>Decided on the Anytone AT-D878, which supports both analog and DMR and has local repeaters in range. Since HF isn’t available with a Technician license, DMR felt like a practical way to explore DX without the cost and complexity of HF infrastructure.</p>
      <p>An HT can also work satellites, and that alone will eventually make the hobby worthwhile.</p>
      <p>I kept expectations low for FM range since I’m not near major repeaters, but again, DMR serves as a backup path. Purchased the radio and will wait to open it until licensed / Christmas.</p>

      <h3>December 3–15, 2025 — Licensing &amp; CW</h3>
      <p>Passed the Technician exam online through PARC and received my call sign a few days later. Having a “Y” means saying “Yankee” a lot, but it’ll do.</p>
      <p>Started learning Morse with the Morse Mania app— CW is more accessible than expected.</p>
      <p>Prepared for operating radio by reading the manual, watching programming videos, and researching New Jersey repeaters.</p>

      <h3>December 25–27, 2025 — Northern New Jersey: First Reception &amp; Net</h3>
      <p>Indoor reception with the stock rubber duck was quiet… I realized I needed to switch from analog to digital monitoring and lower the squelch. Installing a ¼-wave Signal Stick noticeably improved reception. NOAA Weather Radio came in clearly and is a reliable test signal.</p>
      <p>First repeater heard: 442.9 MHz Alpine, NJ (~10–15 miles).</p>
      <p>Listening to my first net on Christmas night was tremendously exciting.</p>

      <h3>December 28–30, 2025 — Jupiter, Florida: Early Nets &amp; DMR</h3>
      <p>Manually programmed several repeaters with offsets and color codes using RepeaterBook. Listened to the weekly Jupiter–Tequesta Ham Club net, which was welcoming and active.</p>
      <p>Tried checking into an AllStar net but discovered afterwards that I had programmed the wrong TX frequency. Registered for a DMR ID and attempted DMR texting with Dad—unsuccessful, likely due to configuration errors.</p>

      <h3>January 1–4, 2026 — Massachusetts: Long-Distance RX &amp; First DMR TX</h3>
      <p>Received W1BIM signal from ~40 miles away, listened to Elmer’s Old Timers nightly net. This far exceeds expectations for indoor second-floor reception using a Signal Stick.</p>
      <p>Exported Massachusetts repeaters from RepeaterBook → codeplug → radio, quickly loading 2–3 dozen repeaters for scanning. Decent Rx from the Prudential Building repeater (W1BOS, ~25 miles).</p>
      <p>First successful DMR transmission happened accidentally while unplugging the programming cable—I inadvertently kerchunked the Marshfield digital repeater (W1ATD) about 30 miles away. Confirmed it registered via BrandMeister. Encouraging TX reach from the first floor with a handheld.</p>

      <h3>January 5–8, 2026 — Antenna Upgrade</h3>
      <p>Bluetooth lets the HT stay upstairs while I move around doing chores—more like listening to a podcast. It makes radio easier to integrate into daily life.</p>
      <p>Ordered a 2m/70cm Slim Jim for window mounting—the best compromise short of a
