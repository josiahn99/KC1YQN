      <h3>November 20–30, 2025 — Radio Purchase</h3>
      <p>Decided on the Anytone AT-D878, which supports both analog and DMR and has local repeaters in range. Since HF isn’t available with a Technician license, DMR felt like a practical way to explore DX without the cost and complexity of HF infrastructure.</p>
      <p>An HT can also work satellites, and that alone will eventually make the hobby worthwhile.</p>
      <p>I kept expectations low for FM range since I’m not near major repeaters, but again, DMR serves as a backup path. Purchased the radio and will wait to open it until licensed / Christmas.</p>

      <h3>December 3–15, 2025 — Licensing &amp; CW</h3>
      <p>Passed the Technician exam online through PARC and received my call sign a few days later. Having a “Y” means saying “Yankee” a lot, but it’ll do.</p>
      <p>Started learning Morse with the Morse Mania app— CW is more accessible than expected.</p>
      <p>Prepared for operating radio by reading the manual, watching programming videos, and researching New Jersey repeaters.</p>

      <h3>December 25–27, 2025 — Northern New Jersey: First Reception &amp; Net</h3>
      <p>Indoor reception with the stock rubber duck was quiet… I realized I needed to switch from analog to digital monitoring and lower the squelch. Installing a ¼-wave Signal Stick noticeably improved reception. NOAA Weather Radio came in clearly and is a reliable test signal.</p>
      <p>First repeater heard: 442.9 MHz Alpine, NJ (~10–15 miles).</p>
      <p>Listening to my first net on Christmas night was tremendously exciting.</p>

      <h3>December 28–30, 2025 — Jupiter, Florida: Early Nets &amp; DMR</h3>
      <p>Manually programmed several repeaters with offsets and color codes using RepeaterBook. Listened to the weekly Jupiter–Tequesta Ham Club net, which was welcoming and active.</p>
      <p>Tried checking into an AllStar net but discovered afterwards that I had programmed the wrong TX frequency. Registered for a DMR ID and attempted DMR texting with Dad—unsuccessful, likely due to configuration errors.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 1–4, 2026 — Massachusetts: Long-Distance RX &amp; First DMR TX</h3>
      <p>Received W1BIM signal from ~40 miles away, listened to Elmer’s Old Timers nightly net. This far exceeds expectations for indoor second-floor reception using a Signal Stick.</p>
      <p>Exported Massachusetts repeaters from RepeaterBook → codeplug → radio, quickly loading 2–3 dozen repeaters for scanning. Decent Rx from the Prudential Building repeater (W1BOS, ~25 miles).</p>
      <p>First successful DMR transmission happened accidentally while unplugging the programming cable—I inadvertently kerchunked the Marshfield digital repeater (W1ATD) about 30 miles away. Confirmed it registered via BrandMeister. Encouraging TX reach from the first floor with a handheld.</p>

      <h3>January 5–8, 2026 — Antenna Upgrade</h3>
      <p>Bluetooth lets the HT stay upstairs while I move around doing chores—more like listening to a podcast. It makes radio easier to integrate into daily life.</p>
      <p>Ordered a 2m/70cm Slim Jim for window mounting—the best compromise short of a permanent outdoor antenna.</p>
      <p>Purchased a Raspberry Pi 3B for hotspot use.</p>
      <p>Tried calling W1BOS for signal reports without response. Suspect terrain (Blue Hills) may be blocking the path. Plan to test from work in Cambridge to rule out configuration issues.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 13, 2026 — First QSO</h3>
      <p>Spent time organizing zones, channels, and scan lists; ChatGPT helped clarify best practices.</p>
      <p>After some Pi-Star troubleshooting (DMR ID needed an “01” suffix), the hotspot worked immediately.</p>
      <p>Completed my first real QSO via the North America talkgroup on BrandMeister—with a station in China. Dad was able to listen in, which made it even better.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 15, 2026 — First FM Transmission</h3>
      <p>Slim Jim arrived and was hung in a second-floor window aimed toward W1BIM. Successfully participated in the W1BIM nightly net and answered the trivia question: Which steam-powered device was patented in 1861? (Otis elevator.)</p>
      <p>A major milestone—~40 miles of FM TX reach using an HT. Received a 59 on signal too. Expectations exceeded once again! It’s addictive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 17, 2026 — New Jersey Net</h3>
      <p>Listened to the nightly NJ statewide linked net on the Alpine, NJ repeater (~13 miles). Reception was dramatically better with the Slim Jim clipped to a window hanger than with the Signal Stick.</p>
      <p>Alpine was full quieting, and I even received a 33 from a wide-area repeater ~50 miles south on 147.375 MHz, despite operating from a north-facing window.</p>
      <p>The Slim Jim is clearly the best non-permanent antenna solution—portable, effective, and easy to deploy anywhere.</p>
      
        <section class="log-entry">
    <h3>January 22, 2026 — Boston</h3>
    <p>Brought the radio to work today to see if the issue with the Prudential repeater was just signal strength or something I was doing wrong digitally. Turns out it was the talk group—I had the wrong number in there. The repeater’s parrot talk group is different from BrandMeister’s.</p>
    <p>Now I can test it from home without other factors interfering.</p>
    <p>Also tried to get APRS transmitting to work, but the first attempt didn’t succeed. Not sure yet what went wrong.</p>

  <section class="log-entry">
    <h3>January 23–25, 2026 — Southern New England</h3>
    <p>Revised my codeplug after learning to use RepeaterBook by distance instead of by state, which immediately revealed Rhode Island repeaters I’d been missing. A major snowstorm activated Skywarn nets and increased general activity, giving me a great chance to test receive performance on the AT-D878 with both repeaters and my hotspot.</p>
    <p>I added more repeaters, including some farther-out systems, plus additional BrandMeister talkgroups. Mt. Washington isn’t common, but under the right tropo conditions it’s not impossible.</p>
    <p>After a couple hours of troubleshooting, I finally received a digital repeater reliably—oddly requiring squelch to be fully open. The radio shows when it’s receiving, but identifying the talkgroup isn’t always obvious unless you’re on the correct time slot. This is especially confusing in southern New England, where many repeaters carry overlapping regional talkgroups. I also realized I’d forgotten to program TG 9 for local traffic.</p>

    <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>On a hotspot, TG 4000 must be keyed to disconnect before switching talkgroups (or wait for timeout).</li>
      <li>The 878 will play both A and B VFOs unless explicitly disabled, which can make Worldwide dominate.</li>
      <li>DMR Monitor (“promiscuous mode”) is powerful for discovery and debugging but can make scanning feel broken if left on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, a few focused hours cleared up a lot of confusion and made the radio feel predictable again.</p>
    <p>Using only a handheld with a Signal Stick on 2 m, I was able to consistently receive repeaters 15–30 miles away indoors, with best results on the second floor and when oriented toward the repeater. Several systems came in clearly despite modest signal reports, showing that placement and orientation mattered as much as distance. Skywarn activity and increased net traffic made it much easier to identify active repeaters and confirm reliable coverage across southern New England.</p>
