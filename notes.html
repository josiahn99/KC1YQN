  <h3>February Update</h3>
  <p>January was my first full month with the Anytone 878. I feel like I’ve got the basics down now — codeplugs make sense, BrandMeister isn’t intimidating anymore, and the hotspot behaves mostly the way I expect it to. Still a beginner, but not lost.</p>
  <p>February has moved fast, but it also feels like I’ve learned so much that it’s been longer than it actually has. Less structured, more exploring. I kept finding new rabbit holes and trying to figure out what parts of this hobby I actually care about most.</p>
  <p>At the beginning of the month, I had my first ISS reception. I used an ISS tracker app and caught an afternoon pass that was almost straight overhead — about 80° elevation. I heard stations from Iowa, Ohio, and Connecticut coming through the International Space Station.</p>
  <p>That was one of those moments where radio stops being abstract. You’re standing there with a handheld, and you’re hearing signals relayed through something orbiting the Earth at 17,000 mph. Having to accommodate for Doppler shift during the 10-minute pass was probably the coolest part. It makes physics feel immediate.</p>

  <h4>Programming + Radio</h4>
  <p>One thing I’ve wanted to do for several years is have an actual reason to buy and work with a Raspberry Pi. With my DMR hotspot running Pi-Star, I finally have an in. I’ve learned some very rudimentary Linux command line skills (git, ssh, nano, sudo, editing config files, etc.), which has been very satisfying.</p>
  <p>I wrote a Python script that takes the Pi-Star log files, parses them, converts the data to JSON, and automatically pushes it to my site using the GitHub API. The site itself is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
  <p>Originally, I tried using Cloudflare Workers, but that turned out to be unnecessary complexity for what I’m doing. I simplified it since my goal is basically a static site and a few focused Python scripts.</p>
  <p>I did have ChatGPT generate the JavaScript for displaying the data and help outline the Python script. It’s been a useful guide, especially when I make sure I understand any lines of code I don’t recognize. At the same time, I’m not trying to memorize syntax (hopeless). I care much more about understanding the concepts. That’s where I want the effort to go. I also wrote a lot of additional Python myself, and that part matters to me.</p>
  <p>Now I’ve got a live dataset of my own activity updating automatically. That opens the door to experimenting — adding geographic info, visualizing patterns, maybe looking at time-of-day trends. Data analysis is another area I’m trying to explore, so this feels like a natural extension.</p>
  <p>It’s small, but it feels like building infrastructure instead of just consuming technology.</p>

  <h4>Operating</h4>
  <p>I’ve made a few QSOs — mostly on TG3100 (USA) and TG91 (Worldwide). Not a ton.</p>
  <p>If I’m honest, when I’m tired I don’t feel like talking. And most days, the only time I really have available to talk is when I’m tired.</p>
  <p>Still, I’m aiming for somewhere between 100–300 QSOs this year. That’s enough to build real experience without turning it into a numbers game.</p>
  <p>I’m also going to try to make time for a couple of weekly nets so I can become more active in the local ham scene.</p>
  <p>It’s easy for me to retreat into theory and projects. But transmitting matters. This is a communication hobby. I don’t want to be the guy who understands antennas but never keys up.</p>

  <h4>What’s Actually Driving This</h4>
  <p>Since I decided to pick up this hobby, I’ve realized what’s really pulling me into amateur radio isn’t just the gear or even the contacts. It’s the science.</p>
  <p>I want to understand what’s happening underneath it all — not just “this works,” but why it works.</p>
  <p>I’ve been influenced a lot by Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe and especially by <em>Remembrance of Earth's Past</em> by Cixin Liu. That trilogy permanently changed how I think about physics and long-term human progress. It made electromagnetic theory feel important — even tied to the future of the human race. And any small bit of knowledge I can acquire contributes, however tiny.</p>
  <p>Right now I’m about halfway through <em>The Radio Theory Handbook</em> by Ron Bertrand (VK2DQ). It’s doing exactly what I need — rebuilding fundamentals before jumping into heavier material.</p>
  <p>The long-term goal is to really understand Maxwell’s equations. Not just recognize them — actually understand what they mean. I had 2–3 years of calculus in high school. I’m rusty, but I don’t think it’s beyond reach if I approach it seriously.</p>
  <p>After finishing <em>The Radio Theory Handbook</em> and brushing up on calculus, I plan to work through <em>Introduction to Electrodynamics</em> by David J. Griffiths.</p>
  <p>I’m realistic. I’m not trying to become a professional physicist. But I want depth. Even undergraduate-level mastery of this material would be meaningful.</p>

  <h4>Broad Direction</h4>
  <p>I don’t want this to turn into ten unrelated hobbies hiding under the word “radio.” I’m trying to let it grow, but in a way that actually builds on itself.</p>
  <p>Right now, that looks like this.</p>
  <p>I want to operate more. I’m aiming for somewhere between 100–300 QSOs this year. Not because the number matters that much, but because I can already see how easy it is for me to retreat into theory and projects instead of actually getting on the air. If I’m tired, I don’t feel like talking. That’s real. But if I never push past that, I won’t grow as an operator.</p>
  <p>I also plan to get my General and Amateur Extra this year. But I don’t want to brute-force the question pool and move on. I’d rather understand the material first and let the exams reflect that. That’s why I’m working through fundamentals and brushing up on calculus before diving into heavier material.</p>
  <p>HF is clearly in my future. I’ve already been thinking through 40 meters, antenna height (around 60 feet if I can manage it), inverted-V options, and what kind of pattern I’d want if I’m trying to work Europe. I don’t want a yard full of random wires, and I don’t want to install something I don’t understand. When I put up an HF antenna, I want to know what it’s doing and why.</p>
  <p>On the programming side, I want to keep building small systems around my station. The automated Pi-Star logging was a good start. I’d like to add geographic info, maybe visualize propagation patterns, and keep refining the site so it feels clean and intentional. Nothing flashy — just steady improvement.</p>
  <p>Underneath all of this is the real reason I’m here: physics. I want Maxwell’s equations to make sense someday. I’m not trying to become a professional physicist. But I do want to understand electromagnetic theory at a level that feels solid and earned. Amateur radio feels like a practical doorway into that world.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of possible side paths — digital modes, SDR, meteor scatter, antenna modeling, hardware builds. I’ll probably touch some of them. But I don’t need to chase everything at once.</p>
  <p>This is going to take years. That’s fine.</p>

  <h3>February 2 - First ISS Reception</h3>
  <p>Used the ISS Tracker app to catch an afternoon pass with roughly 80° elevation. Reception was solid, and I heard stations from Iowa, Ohio, and Connecticut. Ridiculously cool.</p>
</section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>February 24, 2026 — Winter Storm Reception Test</h3>
      <p>
        During a major winter storm that dropped roughly 24 inches of snow, I monitored local repeaters.
        Signals seemed especially clean, and activity was high.
      </p>
      <p>I was able to clearly receive activity from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whitman – WA1NPO</li>
        <li>West Bridgewater</li>
        <li>Bridgewater – W1MV</li>
        <li>Walpole – K1HRV</li>
        <li>Cumberland – NB1RI</li>
        <li>Providence – R1MIX</li>
        <li>Whitman</li>
        <li>Portsmouth – W1SYE</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This confirmed reliable receive coverage across southeastern Massachusetts and into Rhode Island, even under heavy snow.

      <h3>November 20–30, 2025 — Radio Purchase</h3>
      <p>Decided on the <a class="card" href="https://www.gigaparts.com/anytone-at-d878uvii-plus-digital-dmr-dual-band-handheld-commercial-radio-with-gps-aprs-rx-tx-and-bluetooth.html">Anytone AT-D878</a>, which supports both analog and DMR and has local repeaters in range. Since HF isn’t available with a Technician license, DMR felt like a practical way to explore DX without the cost and complexity of HF infrastructure.</p>
      <p>An HT can also work satellites, and that alone will eventually make the hobby worthwhile.</p>
      <p>I kept expectations low for FM range since I’m not near major repeaters, but again, DMR serves as a backup path. Purchased the radio and will wait to open it until licensed / Christmas.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>December 3–15, 2025 — Licensing &amp; CW</h3>
      <p>Passed the Technician exam online through <a class="card" href="https://parcradio.org/">PARC</a> and received my call sign a few days later. Having a “Y” means saying “Yankee” a lot, but it’ll do.</p>
      <p>Started learning Morse with the <strong>Morse Mania app</strong>— CW is more accessible than expected.</p>
      <p>Prepared for operating radio by reading the manual, watching programming videos, and researching New Jersey repeaters.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>December 25–27, 2025 — Northern New Jersey: First Reception &amp; Net</h3>
      <p>Indoor reception with the stock rubber duck was quiet… I realized I needed to switch from analog to digital channel type and lower the squelch from 5 to 1. Installing a ¼-wave Signal Stick noticeably improved reception. NOAA Weather Radio came in clearly and is a reliable test signal.</p>
      <p>First repeater heard: 442.9 MHz Alpine, NJ (~10–15 miles).</p>
      <p>Listening to my first net on Christmas night was tremendously exciting.</p>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>December 28–30, 2025 — Jupiter, Florida: Early Nets &amp; DMR</h3>
      <p>Manually programmed several repeaters with offsets and color codes using RepeaterBook. Listened to the weekly <a class="card" href="https://jtrg.org/">Jupiter–Tequesta Ham Club net</a>, which was welcoming and active.</p>
      <p>Tried checking into an AllStar net but discovered afterwards that I had programmed the wrong TX frequency. Registered for a DMR ID and attempted DMR texting with Dad—unsuccessful, likely due to configuration errors.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 1–4, 2026 — Massachusetts: Long-Distance RX &amp; First DMR TX</h3>
      <p>Received W1BIM signal from ~40 miles away, listened to <a class="card" href="http://www.georgesoldtimersnet.com/">Georges Old Timers nightly net</a>. This far exceeds expectations for indoor second-floor reception using a Signal Stick.</p>
      <p>Exported Massachusetts repeaters from RepeaterBook → codeplug → radio, quickly loading 2–3 dozen repeaters for scanning. Decent Rx from the Prudential Building repeater (W1BOS, ~25 miles).</p>
      <p>First successful DMR transmission happened accidentally while unplugging the programming cable—I inadvertently kerchunked the Marshfield digital repeater (W1ATD) about 30 miles away. Confirmed it registered via BrandMeister. Encouraging TX reach from the first floor with a handheld.</p>

      <h3>January 5–8, 2026 — Antenna Upgrade</h3>
      <p>Bluetooth lets the HT stay upstairs while I move around doing chores—more like listening to a podcast. It makes radio easier to integrate into daily life.</p>
      <p>Ordered a 2m/70cm <a class="card" href="https://n9taxlabs.com/shop/ols/products/dual-band-slim-jim-antenna-with-10-or-16-foot-cable">Slim Jim antenna from N9TAX labs</a> for window mounting—the best compromise short of a permanent outdoor antenna.</p>
      <p>Purchased a Raspberry Pi 3B for hotspot use.</p>
      <p>Tried calling W1BOS for signal reports without response. Suspect terrain (Blue Hills) may be blocking the path. Plan to test from work in Cambridge to rule out configuration issues.</p>

      <h3>January 13, 2026 — First QSO</h3>
      <p>Spent time organizing zones, channels, and scan lists; ChatGPT helped clarify best practices.</p>
      <p>After some Pi-Star troubleshooting (DMR ID needed an “01” suffix), the hotspot worked immediately.</p>
      <p>Completed my first real QSO via the North America talkgroup on BrandMeister—with a station in China. Dad was able to listen in, which made it even better.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 15, 2026 — First FM Transmission</h3>
      <p><a class="card" href="https://n9taxlabs.com/shop/ols/products/dual-band-slim-jim-antenna-with-10-or-16-foot-cable">Slim Jim antenna</a> arrived and was hung in a second-floor window aimed toward W1BIM. Successfully participated in the W1BIM nightly net and answered the trivia question: Which steam-powered device was patented in 1861? (Otis elevator.)</p>
      <p>A major milestone—~40 miles of FM TX reach using an HT. Received a 59 on signal too. Expectations exceeded once again! It’s addictive.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="log-entry">
      <h3>January 17, 2026 — New Jersey Net</h3>
      <p>Listened to a nightly <a class="card" href="https://w2njr.net/">NJ statewide linked net on W2NJR </a> on the Alpine, NJ repeater (~13 miles). Reception was dramatically better with the Slim Jim clipped to a window hanger than with the Signal Stick.</p>
      <p>Alpine was full quieting, and I even received a 33 from a wide-area repeater ~50 miles south on 147.375 MHz, despite operating from a north-facing window.</p>
      <p>The Slim Jim is clearly the best non-permanent antenna solution—portable, effective, and easy to deploy anywhere.</p>

    <h3>January 22, 2026 — Boston</h3>
    <p>Brought the radio to Boston today to see if the issue with the Prudential repeater was just signal strength or something I was doing wrong digitally. Turns out it was the talk group—I had the wrong number in there. The repeater’s parrot talk group is different from BrandMeister’s.</p>
    <p>Now I can test it from home without other factors interfering.</p>
    <p>Also tried to get APRS transmitting to work, but the first attempt didn’t succeed. Not sure yet what went wrong. There seem to be plenty of igates and digipeters around, but I couldn't get myself to show up on APRS.fi. Will try at home.</p>

  <section class="log-entry">
    <h3>January 23–25, 2026 — Southern New England</h3>
    <p>Revised my codeplug -
    </p><p> 1. After learning to use RepeaterBook by distance instead of by state, which added the close-by Rhode Island repeaters I’d been missing. There was a big snowstorm with 12-24 inches, which activated hourly Skywarn nets and increased general activity. With people on the airwaves, it gave me a chance to test receive performance with both the wide area repeaters but more local ones as well.</p>
    <p>2. 2. I added more Brandmeister talkgroups, including USA, TAC310, Casual, Europe, and Australia.</p>
    <p>3. I've tried local digital repeaters, but up to this point I've had trouble with reliable Tx or Rx. After a couple hours of troubleshooting, I finally worked Southborough AE1C. Turning off squelch seemed to help. The radio shows when it’s receiving up in the top corner with bars, but identifying the talkgroup isn’t always obvious unless you’re on the correct time slot. So I was getting full bars but no sound. I think this was due to not programming enough of the talk groups into my radio, and this is especially confusing in southern New England, where many repeaters carry overlapping regional talkgroups. I also realized I’d forgotten to program TG 9 for local traffic.</p>

    <p>Overall, a few focused hours cleared up a lot of confusion and made the radio feel more predictable.</p>
    <p>Using only a handheld with a Signal Stick on 2 m, I was able to consistently receive repeaters 15–30 miles away indoors, with best results on the second floor and when oriented toward the repeater. Several systems came in clearly despite modest signal reports, showing that placement and orientation mattered as much as distance. Skywarn activity and increased net traffic made it much easier to identify active repeaters and confirm reliable coverage across southern New England.</p>

      <h3>January 28-30 - Minuteman Repeater Association</h3>
      After updating my codeplug, my nightly scan picked up the Mendon K1KWP repeater. I was able to receive the nightly Heavy Hitters net with a clear signal.

The following evening, I attempted a transmission requesting a signal check. I did not receive a human response, but the repeater repeated my transmission, confirming that it was received.

This is a significant milestone, as K1KWP is linked to the <a class="card" href="https://mmra.org/">Minuteman Repeater Association</a>, which provides broad statewide coverage. Based on additional testing, I appear to be outside reliable transmit range of other linked repeaters in the network, including W1BOS. But having access to this one means I can reliably access the whole system. <p> 
  </section>
 <section class="log-entry">
  <h3>January 31 – February 1: Things Clicking Into Place</h3>

  <p>
    The last couple of days brought a lot of mental clarity, mostly from spending
    more time listening to active repeaters and working through an expanded
    codeplug.
  </p>

  <p>
    The biggest breakthrough was understanding <strong>Digital Monitor on the AT878</strong>.
    Being able to listen to both time slots or all talkgroups on a single slot makes
    a DMR repeater feel much more like analog. You still need to select the correct
    talkgroup before transmitting, but Digital Monitor is invaluable for getting a
    sense of what’s actually happening on a repeater.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also got a clearer picture of <strong>NEDECN</strong>. As a DMR-MARC network, it’s
    related to but separate from BrandMeister. Some BrandMeister talkgroups are
    bridged, but they’re not the same system. Being in range of the Southborough
    repeater gives me reliable access to NEDECN, which is proving useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another issue finally made sense: changing talkgroups on the Pi-Star hotspot.
    You have to wait until the system is idle before transmitting. On something like
    TG 91 Worldwide, that’s easier said than done, but once I started listening for
    breaks, it became manageable.
  </p>

  <p>
    With these pieces in place, a real monitoring strategy emerged. I can use Digital
    Monitor on the Southborough repeater to hear all DMR activity while keeping an
    analog wide-area repeater like W1BIM or W1BOS on the other channel, or park a
    quieter local repeater there while listening to a busy BrandMeister talkgroup.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, day-to-day VHF and DMR operation is starting to make a lot more sense.
    I also managed a QSO on TG 93 (USA).
