<h3>selected field notes</h3>
  <p>Unless otherwise noted, all observations were made from my backyard (Bortle 7) using an 8-inch Dobsonian (Apertura AD8).</p>

<section class="log-entry">
  <h3>February 17, 2024 – First Light / Jupiter</h3>
  <p>Collimated the AD8 using the included laser collimator. Process was straightforward on the first attempt; future collimation should be quick. Thumb screws from the Apertura upgrade kit significantly simplified adjustment.</p>
  <p>Seeing rated mediocre by Astrospheric; transparency good. Scope set out early for thermal equilibrium.</p>
  <p>Moon observed first: strong contrast at 30 mm; excellent crater detail at 9 mm.</p>
  <p>Jupiter observed with all four Galilean moons visible. Planetary disk bright with faint banding.</p>
  <p>RACI finder alignment refined using the Moon; once calibrated, target acquisition was easy even at higher magnification and low altitude near obstructions and light pollution.</p>

  <h3>April 22, 2024 – M44 (Beehive Cluster)</h3>
  <p>Open cluster clearly resolved despite Bortle 7 conditions.</p>

  <h3>June 1, 2024 – M3 &amp; M53 (Globular Clusters)</h3>
  <p>Most distant objects observed to date. Visibility confirmed that globular clusters are achievable targets even under heavy light pollution.</p>

  <h3>December 13, 2024 – Jupiter &amp; Mars</h3>
  <p>Observed at ~4–8 mm focal lengths. Jupiter showed two prominent orange bands, two lighter bands, and all four moons. Mars appeared large and well-defined.</p>

  <h3>June 11, 2025 – M13 (Hercules Cluster)</h3>
  <p>Observed through the 24-inch research reflector at Loines Observatory, Nantucket, MA. Dramatically higher resolution than an 8-inch Dob: extensive stellar resolution resembling a shimmering web rather than a diffuse glow.</p>
  <p>Also observed Mars through the observatory’s historic 8-inch Alvan Clark refractor (19th century).</p>

  <h3>August 30, 2025 – M57 (Ring Nebula)</h3>
  <p>Planetary nebula easily located near Vega. Initially mistaken for defocus until surrounding stars confirmed sharp focus. Distinct annular shape visible.</p>
