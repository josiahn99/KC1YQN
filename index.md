# Welcome

This site serves to document my progress in learning all things amateur radio, with some Python and Raspberry Pi experimenting on the side.  

So far, my primary project has been setting up a [DMR hotspot](./assembly/).

I'm also actively thinking through [my goals and a learning plan for achieving them](./about/).

Finally, I've put together some tips for new hams with an [Anytone-878](./radio/).

And more for me to just record my own thoughts and progress, but I have [astronomy notes](./astronomy/) and [radio notes](./notes/).

More coming soon. Thanks for stopping by. 73
