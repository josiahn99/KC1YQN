# Welcome

This site documents my progress in learning all things amateur radio — what I’m building, what I’m figuring out, and where I want to go next.

So far, my primary project has been setting up a [DMR hotspot](./assembly/).

I’m also actively working through [my goals and a learning plan for achieving them](./about/).

If you’re running an [Anytone-878](./radio/), I’ve put together some practical notes and tips from my own experience.

I also keep [astronomy notes](./astronomy/) and [radio notes](./notes/) as a place to track what I’m studying and experimenting with.

More coming soon. Thanks for stopping by.
