# Welcome

This site serves to document my progress in learning all things amateur radio, with some Python and Raspberry Pi experimenting on the side.  

So far I have a DMR hotspot up and running.

I'm also figuring out where I want to go with this and figuring out my goals and learning plan.

Also some tips for any new hams using an Anytone-878 as their first radio.

More to come soon. Thanks for stopping by.
